TIME SPENT : 3 Hours 

I took some time trying to understand the exercise, so I finally choose to do it the easiest way, with a very simple movement implementation. 

Additional: I wasn't sure if you wanted me to do the movement settings only by Data (a bit like CardVisualizer with ScriptableObjects) or simply like I did, 
that is to say, to add Teleport I don't have to change my actual code, but only to add a new Class deriving for MoveBehavior class.
